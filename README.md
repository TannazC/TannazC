## Featured Projects

### Lane-Runner FPGA/VGA Game · Verilog, C

Multi lane obstacle avoidance game implemented directly in hardware on a DE1 SoC board.

- Drove a 640×480 VGA display with a custom sprite pipeline and `.mif` ROMs for pixel accurate rendering  
- Implemented player movement using on board keys with collision detection across five discrete lanes  
- Designed a modular architecture with separate Player, Obstacle, and Game state machines plus a render pipeline, using LEDs for rapid hardware debugging

### Hydrofoil Auto Stabilization System · MATLAB, Embedded C

Control system for active stabilization of a human powered hydrofoil.

- Collected and filtered more than 10,000 ultrasonic sensor readings using mean and median filters for reliable altitude sensing  
- Implemented multi axis PID control in MATLAB and embedded C to keep the foil within a stable flight window  
- Integrated control logic with servos and Arduino based actuation, validating performance through simulation and bench tests

### Bridge Load Simulation and Optimisation · Python, MATLAB

Numerical modelling of structural response under moving loads.

- Modelled moving load distribution along a bridge to identify high stress and potential failure zones  
- Used Python (NumPy) and MATLAB to compute and visualise displacement and internal force profiles  
- Explored cross sectional geometry changes to improve performance under repeated loading and increase safety margins

### Semantic Similarity System · Python

Text processing system for measuring similarity between words using vector representations.

- Built semantic descriptor vectors from corpus data and compared them using cosine similarity  
- Implemented dictionary based data structures for efficient lookup, scoring, and evaluation  
- Focused on transparent algorithms and reproducible experiments rather than black box models
