Hi, I'm Tannaz Chowdhury

Computer Engineering student at the University of Toronto, working at the intersection of software, hardware, and control systems. Most projects involve writing code that talks to real hardware, runs on FPGAs, or drives numerical simulation.

Tech Stack

Languages: C/C++, Python, MATLAB, Verilog, SQL

Concepts: Embedded systems, control systems, numerical simulation, FPGA design, data analysis, algorithms

Tools & Platforms: Linux, Git/GitHub, DE1-SoC, VGA pipeline, LTSpice, Onshape CAD

Featured Projects
Lane-Runner FPGA/VGA Game · Verilog, C

Multi-lane obstacle-avoidance game implemented directly in hardware on a DE1-SoC board.

Drove a 640×480 VGA display with a custom sprite pipeline and .mif ROMs for pixel-accurate rendering

Implemented player movement via on-board keys with reliable collision detection across five lanes

Designed a modular architecture with separate Player, Obstacle, and Game state machines plus a render pipeline, using LEDs for fast hardware debugging

Hydrofoil Auto-Stabilization System · MATLAB, Embedded C

Control system for a human-powered hydrofoil’s active stabilization.

Processed 10,000+ ultrasonic sensor readings and applied mean/median filters to clean altitude data

Implemented multi-axis PID control in MATLAB and embedded C to keep the foil within a stable flight window

Integrated control logic with servos and Arduino-based actuation, validating performance through simulation and bench tests

Bridge Load Simulation and Optimisation · Python, MATLAB

Numerical modelling for structural behaviour under moving loads.

Modelled moving load distribution along a bridge to identify high-stress and potential failure zones

Used Python (NumPy) and MATLAB to compute and visualise response under different loading conditions

Explored cross-sectional geometry changes to improve performance under repeated loading

Semantic Similarity System · Python

Text-processing system for measuring similarity between words using vector representations.

Built semantic descriptor vectors from corpus data and compared them using cosine similarity

Implemented dictionary-based data structures for efficient lookup and scoring

Focused on clean data pipelines and reproducible experiments over black-box models
